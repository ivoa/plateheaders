This note describes a FITS header structure suitable for the annotation
of scans of photographic plates containing sky images intended for
scientific use.  This metadata structure is general enough to cover
several observational techniques common in the plate area, such as
multiply exposed plates or objective prism spectroscopy.  While this
metadata structure was being developed together with annotation software
(pyplates) and a specific digitisation project
(applause), we hope it is general enough to serve as a lingua franca for
the annotation of scans of historical photographic observations.

We plan to make stable versions of this document available through the [IVOA
document repository](http://ivoa.net/documents/); we hope this will happen
in 2023.

To build a PDF version this document, you will need a reasonably
complete LaTeX installation, a sufficiently capable `make`, preferably
[latexmk](https://personal.psu.edu/~jcc8/software/latexmk/) and probably
[rsvg-convert](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg). For further
details, see [ivoatexDoc](https://ivoa.net/documents/Notes/IVOATex/).
